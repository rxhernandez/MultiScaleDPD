Process of building a DPD protein to run in LAMMPS:
1. build a MARTINI model of your protein using 
CHARMM-gui(https://www.charmm-gui.org/?doc=input/martini.solution) with martini22 force field. You need two files from the result, charmm-gui-xxxxxxxxx/gromacs/step3_charmm2gmx.pdb is the structure file, and charmm-gui-xxxxxxxxx/gromacs/PROA_P.itp is the MARTINI force field file.
2. Put these two files under the same dir as lib.py and convert.py
3. Open convert.py and step3_charmm2gmx.pdb with a text editor. Modify the line numbers in 
convert.py according to the lines in step3_charmm2gmx.pdb
4. run convert.py (numpy is required)
5. equilibration.lmps and production.lmps are the input files for LAMMPS. Run equilibration first, 
then run production.
6. Advanced useage example avaiable in example2. We add the heme to the pdb generated by CHARMM-gui 
(step3_charmm2gmx.pdb) to generate martini.pdb. Then adding customize bonds and angles that connecting heme and protein backbone as defined in convert.py.
*Note: make sure the LAMMPS has bug fixes for July 2022
